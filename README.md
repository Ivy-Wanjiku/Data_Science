# Data Science Projects
In this repository, you will find different data science files.

## Tupples
Tupples are ordered collections of values that can be of any data type but are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created.

### Applications of Tupples
- Storing Coordinates
 - Storing data and time

 - Return multiple values from a function


## Stack

 A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out principle. For example, the last phone call you had will be the first one to be displayed on the phone call log

### Implementation of stack

Using List
Using Custom Stack class
### Stack Application

-Express Evaluation 

-Parentheses matching 
-Graph  traversal and backtracking
-Recursion
